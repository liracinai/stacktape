# Lambda API with MySQL

- This project deploys a simple Lambda-based HTTP API.
- The application runs in a [Lambda function](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/lambda-functions/) and uses a MySQL
  [relational database](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/) to store the data. To simplify the
  database access, this project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Pricing

- Fixed price resources:

  - **Relational (SQL) database** ($0.017/hour, ~$12.5/month, [free-tier eligible](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all))

- There are also other resources that might incur costs (with pay-per-use pricing). If your load won't get high, the costs will be close to $0.
- You can also control your cloud spend using [budget control](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/budget-control/).

## Prerequisites

If you're deploying from your local machine (not from a CI/CD pipeline), you need the following prerequisites:

- Stacktape installed. To install it, you can follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.stacktape.com/getting-started/setup-stacktape/).

- Node.js installed.
- **(optional) install [Stacktape VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stacktape.vscode-stacktape) with
  validation, autocompletion and on-hover documentation.**

## 1. Generate your project

The command below will bootstrap the project with pre-built application code and pre-configured `stacktape.yml` config file.

```bash
stp init --projectId lambda-api-mysql
```

## 2. Deploy your stack

- To provision all the required infrastructure and to deploy your application to the cloud, all you need is a single
  command.
- The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

```bash
stp deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |
| Europe (London)            | eu-west-2      |
| Europe (Frankfurt)         | eu-central-1   |
| Europe (Milan)             | eu-south-1     |
| Europe (Paris)             | eu-west-3      |
| Europe (Stockholm)         | eu-north-1     |
| US East (Ohio)             | us-east-2      |
| US East (N. Virginia)      | us-east-1      |
| US West (N. California)    | us-west-1      |
| US West (Oregon)           | us-west-2      |
| Canada (Central)           | ca-central-1   |
| Africa (Cape Town)         | af-south-1     |
| Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)   | ap-east-1      |
| Asia Pacific (Mumbai)      | ap-south-1     |
| Asia Pacific (Osaka-Local) | ap-northeast-3 |
| Asia Pacific (Seoul)       | ap-northeast-2 |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore)   | ap-southeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney)      | ap-southeast-2 |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo)       | ap-northeast-1 |
| China (Beijing)            | cn-north-1     |
| China (Ningxia)            | cn-northwest-1 |
| Middle East (Bahrain)      | me-south-1     |
| South America (SÃ£o Paulo)  | sa-east-1      |

## 3. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the console (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

To test the application, you will need the URL of the API Gateway.

It's printed to the console as **mainApiGateway->url**.

### Create a post

Make a `POST` request to `<<your_http_api_gateway_url>>/post` with the JSON data in its body to save the post. Use your preferred HTTP client or
the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST <<your_http_api_gateway_url>>/post -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "title": "MyPost", "content": "Hello!", "authorEmail": "info@stacktape.com"}'
```

If the above cURL command did not work, try escaping the JSON content:

```bash
curl -X POST <<your_http_api_gateway_url>>/post -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ \"title\":\"MyPost\",\"content\":\"Hello!\",\"authorEmail\":\"info@stacktape.com\"}'
```

### Get all posts

Make a `GET` request to `<<your_http_api_gateway_url>>/posts` to get all posts.

```bash
curl <<your_http_api_gateway_url>>/posts
```

## 4. Run the application in development mode

To run functions in the development mode (remotely on AWS), you can use the
[fn:develop command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/fn-develop/). For example, to develop and debug lambda function `savePost`, you can use

```bash
stp fn:develop --region <<your-region>> --stage <<stage>> --resourceName savePost
```

The command will:

- quickly re-build and re-deploy your new function code
- watch for the function logs and pretty-print them to the terminal

The function is rebuilt and redeployed, when you either:

- type `rs + enter` to the terminal
- use the `--watch` option and one of your source code files changes

## 5. Deploying only the application code

- The deployment using the [deploy](/cli/commands/deploy/) command uses
  [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.If you only want to deploy your source code (not any configuration changes), you can use
  [fn:deploy-fast](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/fn-deploy-fast/). The deployment will be significantly faster (only a few seconds).

```bash
stacktape fn:deploy-fast --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>> --resourceName <<name-of-the-lambda-to-deploy>>
```

## 6. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stp delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
pipeline and other aspects of your services. You can deploy your services to multiple environments (stages) - for
example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`.

Stack is a running instance of a service. It consists of your application code (if any) and the infrastructure resources
required to run it.

The configuration for this service is described below.

## 1. Service name

You can choose an arbitrary name for your service. The name of the stack will be constructed as
`{service-name}-{stage}`.

```yml
serviceName: posts-api-pg
```

## 2. Resources

- Every resources must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
- Stacktape resources are "high-level". They consist of multiple underlying AWS (or 3rd party) resources.

### 2.1 HTTP API Gateway

API Gateway receives requests and routes them to the container.

For convenience, it has [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) allowed.

```yml
resources:
  mainApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cors:
        enabled: true
```

### 2.2 MySQL relational database

The application data is stored in a MySQL database. The database is configured as follows:

- **Database credentials**. In this example, we input them directly. For production workloads, you should use
  [secrets](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/secrets/) to store them securely.

- **Engine type**. We are using `mysql` engine. It uses a single-node database server - the simplest and cheapest
  option.

- **Instance size**. We are using the `db.t2.micro` instance. It has 1 vCPU, 1GB of memory, and is free-tier eligible
  (~$12.5/month without a free tier). To see the full list of available options, refer to
  [AWS instance type list](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/).

By default, the version used for the database is the latest AWS-supported stable version (currently `8.0.27`). Minor
version upgrades are done automatically.

You can also configure many other aspects of your database, such as
[storage](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#storage),
[logging](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#logging),
[read replicas](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#read-replicas), or
[failover instances](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#multi-az-mode).

```yml
mainDatabase:
  type: relational-database
  properties:
    credentials:
      masterUserName: admin_user
      masterUserPassword: my_secret_password
    engine:
      type: mysql
      properties:
        primaryInstance:
          instanceSize: db.t2.micro
```

### 2.3 Functions

The core of our application consists of two serverless functions:

- **savePost function** - saves post into database
- **getPosts function** - get all posts from the database

Functions are configured as follows:

- **Packaging** - determines how the lambda artifact is built. The easiest and most optimized way to build the lambda
  from Typescript/Javascript is using `stacktape-lambda-buildpack`. We only need to configure `entryfilePath`. Stacktape
  automatically transpiles and builds the application code with all of its dependencies, creates the lambda zip
  artifact, and uploads it to the pre-created S3 bucket on AWS. You can also use
  [other types of packaging](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-lambda-functions).
- **Database connection string** - we are passing it to the function as an environment variable. The connection string
  can be easily referenced using a
  [$ResourceParam() directive](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives/#resource-param). This directive
  accepts a resource name (`mainDatabase` in this case) and the name of the
  [relational database referenceable parameter](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/#referenceable-parameters)
  (`connectionString` in this case). If you want to learn more, refer to
  [referencing parameters](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/referencing-parameters/) guide and
  [directives](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives) guide.
- **Events** - Events determine how is function triggered. In this case, we are triggering the function when an event
  (HTTP request) is delivered to the HTTP API gateway:

  - if URL path is `/post` and HTTP method is `POST`, request is delivered to `savePost` function.
  - if URL path is `/posts` and HTTP method is `GET`, request is delivered to `getPosts` function.

  Event(request) including the request body is passed to the function handler as an argument.

```yml
savePost:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/lambdas/save-post.ts
      memory: 512
      environment:
        - name: DB_CONNECTION_STRING
          value: $ResourceParam('mainDatabase', 'connectionString')
      events:
        - type: http-api-gateway
          properties:
            httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
            path: /post
            method: POST

  getPosts:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/lambdas/get-posts.ts
      memory: 512
      environment:
        - name: DB_CONNECTION_STRING
          value: $ResourceParam('mainDatabase', 'connectionString')
      events:
        - type: http-api-gateway
          properties:
            httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
            path: /posts
            method: GET
```

## 3. Database migration hooks

To simplify database access and migrations, this project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). If you're not familiar
with it, don't worry - it's very simple. [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
for this application is already configured at `prisma/schema.prisma` in the project directory.

### 3.1 Generate Prisma client

Prisma offers a database client that we can import into our code. To generate it, we use the `npx prisma generate`
command. To do it automatically every time before the stack is deployed, the command is saved as a
[script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) and then used inside a `before:deploy`
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

```yml
serviceName: posts-api-pg

scripts:
  generatePrismaClient:
    executeCommand: npx prisma generate

hooks:
  - triggers: ['before:deploy']
    scriptName: generatePrismaClient
```

### 3.2 Prisma database migration

To sync our Prisma schema with the database, we need to use `npx prisma db push` command. We can't do this before the
database is created, so we use the `after:deploy` hook.

We also need to pass the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to the script. We do it using the
[$ResourceParam()](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives/#resource-param) directive that will
automatically download the connection string value and pass it to the script.

```yml
scripts:
  generatePrismaClient:
    executeCommand: npx prisma generate
    migrateDb:
    executeCommand: npx prisma db push --skip-generate
    environment:
      - name: DB_CONNECTION_STRING
        value: $ResourceParam('mainDatabase', 'connectionString')

hooks:
  - triggers: ["before:deploy"]
    scriptName: generatePrismaClient
    - triggers: ["after:deploy"]
    scriptName: migrateDb
```

You can also execute the migration script anytime using

```bash
stp script:run --scriptName migrateDb --stage <<previously-used-stage>> --region <<previously-used-region>>
```
